Hi,



I was walking down the street when I saw a woman fall off her bike. She was taken to the hospital with a broken arm. She was wearing a helmet, so she didn't hit her head. The accident happened on a busy street, so there were many witnesses. To make a living she works as a surgeon.


Sincerely,
Jane Smith
